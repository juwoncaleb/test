            Luxury closet NG was established in 2016 to serve as a bridge
            between streetwear and the ever stylish youths of West Africa and
            the world at large. In the past few years, there has been a
            skyrocketing demand for streetwear in Africa, with youths from
            different backgrounds becoming more comfortable expressing
            themselves through fashion.{" "}

            Despite this development, it seems like looking luxurious or dapper
            like our favourite celebrities or icons is a luxury only available
            to the “wealthy” or a selected few.

            Luxury closet NG was born to defeat that narrative. Our mission is
            to make high end streetwear available to not just a “privileged” few
            but to everyone who is willing to express themselves by looking
            their best, therefore promoting the streetwear culture not only in
            West Africa but the world at large. We are currently available in
            Lagos. but thanks to our worldwide delivery services…we are not
            limited from pushing the streetwear culture globally. We are Luxury
            Closet NG, your one stop shop for high end streetwear.
